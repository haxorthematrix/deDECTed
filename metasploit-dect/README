To install:

COA Mixin:

1. Copy coa.rb [msf directory]/lib/msf/core/exploit/ 
2. Edit [msf directory]/lib/msf/core/exploit.rb and add require 'msf/core/exploit/coa'

Example Scanner Modules:

1. Create [msf directory]/modules/auxiliary/scanner/coa/ directory
2. Copy call_scanner.rb and station_scanner.rb to the above directory

Notes/Bugs: 

1. This module relies on the COM-ON-AIR Linux driver and as such won't 
work with Windows systems.

2. Call recording is still a work in progress, currently the call module 
just identifies and logs the time of active calls.

-- Your patches are welcome :)

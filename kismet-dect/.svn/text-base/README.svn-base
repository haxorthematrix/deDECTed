                            KISMET DECT MODULES
                            ===================

PREREQUISITES:
=============

In order to use the Kismet DECT plugins, you need the latest kismet-newcore 
from the Kismet subversion repository. The code here is NOT usable with the 
current Kismet stable release, since Kismet supports modules only in newcore.

Get kismet-newcore like so:

 svn co http://svn.kismetwireless.net/code/branch/kismet-newcore kismet-newcore

Build & Install:

 cd kismet-newcore
 ./configure 
 make
 make install

KISMET-DECT PLUGINS:
===================

You can find the Kismet DECT client and server modules subversion repository at
the following url:

    https://dedected.org/svn/trunk/kismet-dect

Use subversion to check out the trunk like so:

    svn co https://dedected.org/svn/trunk/kismet-dect

You then should see these directories:

    client_module/ -- Contains the Kismet client module code
    server_module/ -- Contains the Kismet server module code

NOTE: Make sure the environment variables KIS_DEST_DIR and KIS_SRC_DIR point to
something useful. These variables are used in the Makefile and default to the 
following directories:
    
    KIS_DEST_DIR=/usr/local
    KIS_SRC_DIR=/usr/src/kismet-newcore

Change them according to your environment. For example, if your kismet-newcore
source is at /home/user/src/kismet-newcore and your Kismet installation is at
/home/user/tools/kismet-build, adapt your environment like so:

    export KIS_SRC_DIR=/home/user/src/kismet-newcore
    export KIS_DEST_DIR=/home/user/tools/kismet-build

Then, you're ready to build:

    make -C client_module && make -C server_module

Install:

    make -C client_module install && make -C server_module install

You are then able to start kismet_server and kismet_client and should be able
to choose the Kismet DECT plugin from the menu.

CONFIG:
======

Make sure to add the following source to your kismet.conf: 

Device:

    ncsource=dect:device=/dev/coa

Logtype:

    logtypes=dectpcap

FEATURES:
========

Functionality that works as of now:

 * FP scan
 * Sorting FP scan results by RFPI, RSSI, seen count, and channel
 * Locking channels for FP scan
 * PP (call) scan
 * Dumping pcap in for call (PP scan) or station (FP scan) (alpha, please test)

Stuff being worked on:

 * GPS support
 * Dump .wav files

HOTKEYS:
=======

Currently, after loading the DECT plugin into the client, you need to use 
certain hotkeys to tell it what to do. Here is a list of keys and what they do:

   ---------+---------------------------------------------
    KEY     | ACTION
   ---------+---------------------------------------------
    h       | Display this help
    L       | Lock channel hopping to current channel
    U       | Unlock channel hopping
    F       | Do async FP scan (default)
    A       | Do async PP scan
    M       | Show current mode
    i       | Sort by RFPI (ascending)
    I       | Sort by RFPI (descending)
    r       | Sort by RSSI (ascending)
    R       | Sort by RSSI (descending)
    c       | Sort by Channel (ascending)
    C       | Sort by Channel (descending)
    s       | Sort by view count (ascending)
    S       | Sort by view count (descending)
    Q       | Quit
    <enter> | Sync with selected station and dump calls
   -------------------------------------------------------

Q&A:
===

Q: I don't seem to be able to use the hotkeys or scroll through the station
   list. What's wrong?
A: Maybe you choose the wrong window? Try <tab>ing you way to the DECT plugin
   and then try again.

BUGS/FEATURE REQUESTS:
=====================

The code is currently quite rough and may contain bugs. If you find a serious bug or
if you would like to request some feature, please use our ticket system at:
